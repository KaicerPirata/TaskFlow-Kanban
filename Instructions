Here's a step-by-step guide to upload your project to GitHub:

**1. Initialize a Git repository in your project directory (if you haven't already):**

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

**2. Stage the files you want to commit:**

   ```bash
   git add .  # This adds all files in the current directory and its subdirectories
   ```

**3. Commit your changes with a descriptive message:**

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit or commit message describing the changes"
   ```

**4. Create a new repository on GitHub:**

   *   Go to the GitHub website (www.github.com) and log in.
   *   Click the "+" button in the upper right corner and select "New repository".
   *   Give your repository a name.
   *   Choose whether you want the repository to be public or private.
   *   You can optionally add a description and a README file.
   *   Click "Create repository".

**5. Connect your local repository to the remote GitHub repository:**

   *   On the GitHub repository page, you will see instructions for connecting an existing repository.  Copy the appropriate `git remote add origin ...` command. It should look like this:
       ```bash
       git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
       ```
       (Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME` with your GitHub username and repository name.)

**6. Push your local commits to the remote repository:**

   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

   * The `-u` option sets up tracking, so subsequent pushes can be done with just `git push`.
   * If your default branch is not `main`, use the appropriate branch name (e.g., `git push -u origin master`).

**Important Considerations:**

*   **.gitignore:** Make sure you have a `.gitignore` file in your project directory to exclude files that should not be committed to the repository (e.g., `node_modules`, `.env` files containing sensitive information).  You can find useful `.gitignore` templates online (e.g., search for "gitignore template for nodejs").
*   **Authentication:** You may be prompted for your GitHub username and password, or you may need to set up SSH keys for authentication.  GitHub provides instructions on how to do this.
*   **Existing Repository:** If you already have a repository on GitHub, you should clone it to your local machine first, then copy the files in the app to your local repository, and follow steps 2, 3 and 6.
