To complete the requested changes, perform the following steps manually:

1.  **Create a new GitHub repository:**

    *   Go to the following URL: `https://github.com/KaicerPirata/UCC-GO.git`
    *   If the repository does not already exists, then create it with the name `UCC-GO`. You can choose whether to make it public or private.

2.  **Inspect the Project for Secrets:**

    *   Carefully review all the files in your local project for any sensitive information, such as API keys, passwords, or other credentials. These should _never_ be committed directly to a public repository.
    *   If you find any secrets, take steps to remove them from the files and store them securely (e.g., using environment variables or a dedicated secrets management solution).  Make sure your .gitignore file is set up correctly (see step 3).

3.  **Create or Update .gitignore file:**

    *   Make sure your project has a `.gitignore` file. This file tells Git which files or folders to exclude from version control.
    *   Add entries to your `.gitignore` file to exclude any files containing secrets, build artifacts, or other files that should not be committed to the repository. Some common entries include:

        ```
        node_modules/
        .env
        build/
        dist/
        ```

4.  **Commit all the changes:**

    *   After completing the steps above, stage all the changes, and commit them.

        ```bash
        git add .
        git commit -m "Initialize project and connect to GitHub"
        ```

    *   This command will stage all modified and newly created files in your project directory.
    *   This command will commit the staged changes to your local Git repository with a descriptive message.

5.  **Push the local repository to remote:**

    *   Run the following commands in your terminal, within the project directory:

        ```bash
        git remote add origin https://github.com/KaicerPirata/UCC-GO.git
        git branch -M main
        git push -u origin main
        ```

    *   These commands do the following:
        *   `git remote add origin <repository-url>`: This command sets the remote repository for your local repository. Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.
        *   `git branch -M main`: This command renames the default branch from master to main.
        *   `git push -u origin main`: This command pushes the changes from your local repository to the remote repository on GitHub. The `-u` flag sets up tracking, so you can use `git push` and `git pull` in the future without specifying the remote and branch.

6.  **Replace this file:**
    * Rename this file to what it says. This file should not be committed.

Failure to follow these steps, especially concerning the handling of sensitive information, could lead to security vulnerabilities.
